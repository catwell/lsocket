	<h1>lsocket - simple and easy socket support for lua</h1>
	<h2>What is it?</h2>
	<p>lsocket is a library to provide socket programming support for
		lua. It is not intended to be a complete socket api, but easy to
		use and good enough for most tasks. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are
		supported, as are tcp and udp, and also IPv4 broadcasts and
		IPv6 multicasts. Also, lsocket is almost nonblocking, meaning
		that nothing blocks except for nameserver lookups.</p>

	<h3>What's new in version 1.3</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Unix domain sockets.</li>
		<li>socket:getfd(), socket:setfd()</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>What's new in version 1.2</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>tweaked lsocket.resolve() in order to reduce duplicates.</li>
		<li>there is now an experimental asynchronous dns resolver as an
			additional library included, but that is not an official part
			of lsocket. Please see doc/README_ARESOLVER in the distribution
			archive for more infos.</li>
		<li>somewhat more thorough check for whether a host address is
			an ip address, i.e. needs no resolving.</li>
		<li>some minor tweaks.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>What's new in version 1.1</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>lsocket.connect() is now also nonblocking, apart from nameserver
			lookups.</li>
		<li>socket:status() method added to query sockets for errors
			(necessary because of non-blocking connect(), but also handy
			for other situations)</li>
		<li>nicer SIGPIPE handling, using socket or send options where
			possible, and disabling SIGPIPE for the send/sendto operation
			only where options are not available.</li>
		<li>the included rshttpd.lua example httpd library now supports
			keepalive connections.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>What's new in version 1.0.2</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>just 2 more examples, one http client and one http server, to
			illustrate the hoops you have to jump through in order to take
			advantage of the non-blocking nature of lsocket.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>What's new in version 1.0.1</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>enhance check of whether a nslookup is needed, should now
			cover all cases</li>
		<li>modified select() to ignore closed sockets, also calling
			select() without open sockets and without timeout is now an
			error (instead of blocking forever).</li>
		<li>added constant _VERSION, which contains the full version number
			for lsocket.</li>
		<li>fixed an issue that would keep the Mac's from compiling this</li>
		<li>some cleanup in the 5.1/5.2 compatibility department as
			suggested by lhf</li>
	</ul>
