	<h1>lsocket - simple and easy socket support for lua</h1>
	<h2>What is it?</h2>
	<p>lsocket is a library to provide socket programming support for
		lua. It is not intended to be a complete socket api, but easy to
		use and good enough for most tasks. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are
		supported, as are tcp and udp, and also IPv4 broadcasts and
		IPv6 multicasts. Also, lsocket is almost nonblocking, meaning
		that nothing blocks except for nameserver lookups.</p>

	<h3>What's new in version 1.4 (2015-04-17)</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Lua 5.3 compatibility (or rather, some cleanup in the number handling department)</li>
		<li>socket fd's are checked against FD_SETSIZE now in select()</li>
		<li>changed build type to make</li>
		<li>converted all documentation to markdown</li>
		<li>fixed bug: send and sendto would not correctly return false on timeout (patch by 云风)</li>
	</ul>
